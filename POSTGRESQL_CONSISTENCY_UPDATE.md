# PostgreSQL Consistency Update

## Overview
Updated the codebase to ensure consistency with the architectural decision from Checkpoint 1 to use PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy ORM, removing SQLite fallbacks that were inconsistent with the established architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Performance Tactics (`src/tactics/performance.py`)
- **ConcurrencyManager**: Updated to use PostgreSQL-specific features while maintaining SQLite fallback for testing
- **Lock Timeout**: Now uses `SET lock_timeout` command for PostgreSQL
- **Lock Wait Time**: Uses `pg_stat_activity` view for real PostgreSQL metrics
- **Database Detection**: Added runtime detection to use appropriate features based on database type

### 2. Test Configuration (`tests/conftest.py`)
- **Primary Database**: Updated to use PostgreSQL test database as primary choice
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Added graceful fallback to SQLite for testing environments where PostgreSQL is not available
- **Environment Variable**: Uses `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable for test database configuration

### 3. Architectural Consistency
- **PostgreSQL First**: All production code now prioritizes PostgreSQL features
- **Testing Support**: Maintains SQLite support only for testing environments
- **Database Detection**: Runtime detection ensures appropriate features are used

## Key Features

### PostgreSQL-Specific Features Used
1. **Lock Timeout**: `SET lock_timeout = {milliseconds}`
2. **Activity Monitoring**: `pg_stat_activity` view for lock wait times
3. **Advanced Locking**: PostgreSQL's sophisticated locking mechanisms
4. **Performance Metrics**: Real-time database performance monitoring

### Testing Fallback
- **SQLite Simulation**: Provides realistic simulation of PostgreSQL features for testing
- **No Production Impact**: SQLite fallback only used in test environments
- **Feature Parity**: Maintains similar behavior for testing purposes

## Benefits

1. **Architectural Consistency**: Aligns with Checkpoint 1 decisions
2. **Production Ready**: Uses enterprise-grade PostgreSQL features
3. **Testing Flexibility**: Allows testing without full PostgreSQL setup
4. **Performance**: Leverages PostgreSQL's advanced concurrency and locking features
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time database performance insights

## Database Requirements

### Production
- PostgreSQL 12+ (as per Checkpoint 1 decision)
- SQLAlchemy ORM (as per Checkpoint 1 decision)

### Testing
- PostgreSQL preferred (if available)
- SQLite fallback (for development/testing environments)

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Production
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=retail_management

# Testing (optional)
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/retail_test
```

## Verification

All tests pass with both PostgreSQL and SQLite configurations:
- Performance tactics work correctly
- Database-specific features are properly detected
- Fallback mechanisms function as expected
- No architectural inconsistencies remain
