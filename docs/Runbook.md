## Quality Scenario Validation

### Comprehensive Quality Scenario Test
Run the comprehensive quality scenario validation to verify 100% compliance:

```bash
# Run comprehensive quality scenario validation (from project root)
python comprehensive_quality_scenarios_test.py

# Expected output:
# ðŸŽ¯ COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY SCENARIO VALIDATION
# Total Quality Scenarios: 15
# Fulfilled Scenarios: 15
# Success Rate: 100.0%
# ðŸŽ‰ ALL QUALITY SCENARIOS SUCCESSFULLY VALIDATED!
```

**Note**: The `comprehensive_quality_scenarios_test.py` file is located in the project root directory, not in the `tests/` directory. This provides a standalone validation of all quality scenarios.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Test Timeouts**: Some tests may take longer due to retry logic
4. **Mock Service Errors**: Check mock service configuration

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debug output
python -m pytest tests/ -v -s --tb=long

# Run specific failing test
python -m pytest tests/test_availability_tactics.py::TestCircuitBreakerPattern::test_circuit_breaker_failure_trips_open -v -s
```
